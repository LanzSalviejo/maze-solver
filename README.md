## Prerequisites

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
- [Tkinter](https://riptutorial.com/tkinter/example/3206/installation-or-setup) - binding to the Tk GUI toolkit.

> Tkinter comes pre-installed with the Python installer binaries for **Mac OS X** and the **Windows** platform. 
> So if you install Python from the official binaries for Mac OS X or Windows platform, you are good to go with Tkinter.
> 
> For Debian versions of **Linux** you have to install it manually by using the following commands.
> ```shell script
> sudo apt-get install python3-tk
> ```
